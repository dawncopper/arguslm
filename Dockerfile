# Note: tests are run by CI on every commit (matrix across Python 3.11–3.14).
# We deliberately do NOT run pytest here — `RUN pytest ... || true` masks
# failures and would let a broken build ship to Docker Hub via the auto-publish
# workflow on tag push. CI is the gate; the Docker build only assembles bytes.
